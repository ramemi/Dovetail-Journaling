The purpose of the Dovetail Journaling software is to give people an alternative to types of social media where friend recommendations are made through topics or categories that a user must explicitly select. With Dovetail Journaling the user is meant to write brief journal entries about their thoughts and current life events, and then the software will recommend other users to get in touch with based on similarities in the topics and sentiments (e.g. positive, negative, neutral) expressed in both usersâ€™ journal entries. This adds a social element to the traditionally internal and reflective activity of journaling.

Please see Dovetail_Journaling_Documentation.pdf for the full explanation and 4+1 view model of the application.

This project was meant to showcase the application of design patterns. It is not secure nor does it handle exceptions.
